I am an AI Research Scientist at [Autodesk AI Lab](https://www.research.autodesk.com/research-areas/science/ai-lab/), working on CAD generation and reconstruction. Before that, I did 2 year PhD study in [GrUVi](https://gruvi.cs.sfu.ca) at [Simon Fraser University](https://www.sfu.ca), under the supervision of [Prof. Hao (Richard) Zhang](https://www.cs.sfu.ca/~haoz). I obtained my master's degree in Computer Science in [VCC](https://vcc.tech/index.html) at [Shenzhen University](https://en.szu.edu.cn/), under the supervision of [Prof. Hui Huang](https://vcc.tech/~huihuang). I also hold a Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering from [Sichuan University](https://en.scu.edu.cn/).

My research focuses on CAD reconstruction and generation, learning-based 3D modeling and path planning for MVS reconstruction.
